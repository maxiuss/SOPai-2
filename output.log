Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This process involves capturing light energy using pigments like chlorophyll, absorbing carbon dioxide from the air, and using water from the roots to produce glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in the ecosystems as it is the primary pathway for energy conversion in most living organisms.
